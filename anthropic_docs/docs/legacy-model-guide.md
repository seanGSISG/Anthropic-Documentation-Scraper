Get started with Claude
​
Choosing a model
If you’re unsure which model to use, we recommend starting with
Claude Sonnet 4.5
. It offers the best balance of intelligence, speed, and cost for most use cases, with exceptional performance in coding and agentic tasks.
All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available via the Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

1 - Aliases automatically point to the most recent model snapshot. When we release new model snapshots, we migrate aliases to point to the newest version of a model, typically within a week of the new release. While aliases are useful for experimentation, we recommend using specific model versions (e.g.,
claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
) in production applications to ensure consistent behavior.
2 - See our
pricing page
for complete pricing information including batch API discounts, prompt caching rates, extended thinking costs, and vision processing fees.
3 - Claude Sonnet 4.5 supports a
1M token context window
when using the
context-1m-2025-08-07
beta header.
Long context pricing
applies to requests exceeding 200K tokens.
4 -
Reliable knowledge cutoff
indicates the date through which a model’s knowledge is most extensive and reliable.
Training data cutoff
is the broader date range of training data used. For example, Claude Sonnet 4.5 was trained on publicly available information through July 2025, but its knowledge is most extensive and reliable through January 2025. For more information, see
Anthropic’s Transparency Hub
.
Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.
Starting with
Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all future models
, AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI offer two endpoint types:
global endpoints
(dynamic routing for maximum availability) and
regional endpoints
(guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions). For more information, see the
third-party platform pricing section
.
Legacy models
The following models are still available but we recommend migrating to current models for improved performance:

beta header.
Long context pricing

Training data cutoff
is the broader date range of training data used.
3 - Some Haiku models have a single training data cutoff date.
4 - Include the beta header
output-128k-2025-02-19
in your API request to increase the maximum output token length to 128K tokens for Claude Sonnet 3.7. We strongly suggest using our
streaming Messages API
to avoid timeouts when generating longer outputs. See our guidance on
long requests
for more details.
​
Prompt and output performance
Claude 4 models excel in:
Performance
: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the
Claude 4 blog post
for more information.
Engaging responses
: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.
If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our
prompt engineering guides
for details.
For specific Claude 4 prompting best practices, see our
Claude 4 best practices guide
.
Output quality
: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.
​
Migrating to Claude 4.5
If you’re currently using Claude 3 models, we recommend migrating to Claude 4.5 to take advantage of improved intelligence and enhanced capabilities. For detailed migration instructions, see
Migrating to Claude 4.5
.
